# üß† Postpartum Depression Analysis  

## üìñ Project Overview  
This project analyzes postpartum depression (PPD) using a dataset containing various features related to maternal health, psychological well-being, and socio-economic factors. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and key indicators associated with PPD through **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and machine learning techniques**.  

By leveraging **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn**, we aim to provide insights that could help in early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

## üìä Dataset Information  
- **Dataset Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parvezalmuqtadir2348/postpartum-depression/data 
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Utilizes a real-world dataset of 1,503 records collected from a medical hospital via a Google Form questionnaire.
- **Focused Analysis:** Examines 9 key attributes related to postpartum depression, with "Feeling Anxious" as the target variable.

## üîç Analysis Performed  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Encoded categorical variables.  
   - Standardized numerical features for better model performance.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified trends and correlations between features.  
   - Examined distribution of depression scores.  
   - Visualized relationships using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.  

3. **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
   - Identified key predictors contributing to postpartum depression.  
   - Applied correlation analysis to reduce multicollinearity.  

4. **Model Implementation**  
   - Trained machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

5. **Results & Insights**  
   - Discovered key risk factors for postpartum depression.  
   - Developed a predictive model to assess depression risk.
